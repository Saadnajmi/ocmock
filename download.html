<h2>Stable Releases</h2>

<p>The disk images contain frameworks for macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS development, a static library for iOS development, and the source code. As of OCMock 3.9.0 the binary distribution contains XCFrameworks.

<p>Usually the releases can be used on newer systems, too. For example, OCMock 3.1, built with Xcode 6.2 using the OS X 10.10 and iOS 8.2 SDKs, can also be built with Xcode 7 and its newer SDKs.

<p>However, there is no guarantee that a release of OCMock can be built with versions of Xcode older than the current stable version at release.

<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>The source code for OCMock is available on GitHub
	<span id="cistatus"><a href="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock.svg?branch=master"></a></span>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock">https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock</a>

<p>It is built and tests are run by Travis CI. The current status is shown above on the right. If this isn't showing <i>passing</i>, chances are the code is currently not building correctly and we're busy trying to fix it. In all other cases, a local build from source should work.
